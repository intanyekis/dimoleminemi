The couple had been together for about a decade, and there had been accusations that Disick had been disloyal throughout that time. Their relationship ended after he again mistreated Kardashian, but did he ever really cheat on her?</p><h2>The relationship between Disick and Kardashian was full of drama.</h2><p>In 2006, they met at a house party where they both had friends. By 2007, they were dating, and no one would have thought that they would be together for almost a decade.</p><p>At first, Kardashian’s family didn’t really like Disick. They thought he was rude and needed to stop drinking so much.</p><p>Disick’s behavior caused them to fight a lot, and he drank too much — something he has admitted in the past — right up until they broke up for good in 2015.</p><p><b>Read More: </b><a href=#>How Did Andrea Bocelli Lose His Eyesight?

In one episode, Kardashian sisters Khloé and Kim Kardashian looked through Disick’s phone and discovered that he had texted another lady.</p><p>Disick expressed his desire to spend a week with the woman “without telling Kourt,” according to the messages. Even though it was tough to convey such bad news, Khloé and Kim told their sister what they had discovered.</p><p>Kardashian then claimed Disick of cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend, and the two ended their relationship. She and her sister Khloé were filming Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami around the same time.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bplut1WnRba/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=5b9909a9-cde5-4b0d-96a5-86c8b1cda5d1</p><p><b>Read More: </b><a href=#>Is Jennifer Aniston Believe That Brad Pitt Cheated On Her? Everything You Need To Know</a></p><h2>Disick’s party on a ship with his ex led to the couple’s separation.</h2><p>Kardashian and Disick have had many issues throughout the years, but they also have 3 children together, so things were definitely going well for the most part.</p><p>However, photographs showing Disick partying on a yacht with a group of ladies got him in hot water yet again. Disick was spotted going close to his ex, Chloe Bartoli, and even massaging her back.</p><p>Kardashian had had enough by then, and the two ended their relationship permanently in 2015.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bplut1WnRba/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=5b9909a9-cde5-4b0d-96a5-86c8b1cda5d1</p><p><b>Read More: </b><a href=#>Did David Beckham Cheat On Victoria: Is Cheating Allegations True?

They went to counseling together (and still do), and it helped them grow as friends.</p><p>For more than two years, Disick has been dating Sofia Richie, and Kardashian and Richie get along swimmingly. Disick and Richie have even gone on family holidays with the Kardashians, and Disick once shared a photo of himself sitting between the two women in a lounge chair.</p><p>Kardashian and Disick seem to have figured out how to raise their kids together and love each other even more than when they were having dated.</p><p><b>Read More: </b><a href=#>Britney Spears Has Revealed That She Has Suffered A “Devastating” Miscarriage</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX5m2pXnSnKatrF2Ytaat02amp2WbpMKzwM2esGadppq%2FusDHoqWgZamkwm66xJ6bZqyfYrivu9Zo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heres-why-jennifer-love-hewitts-the-ghost-whisperer-was-canceled.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here's Why Jennifer Love Hewitt's 'The Ghost Whisperer' Was Canceled</a>
