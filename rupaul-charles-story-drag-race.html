It's true! RuPaul has lived many lives before soliciting himself as the world's most successful drag queen - on top of that, quickly being one of America's most beloved television hosts. This is the rags to riches story of how RuPaul took his admiration for entertaining to become an eight time Emmy snagging superstar.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>&nbsp;The Cost of RuPaul's Drag Race: The Price Contestants Pay To Compete</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-queen-of-manhattan>The Queen of Manhattan</h2><p>Born RuPaul Andre Charles on November 17, 1960, the star-to-be spent a great deal of his childhood in the city of San Fransisco where he&nbsp;lived with his mother until he was fifteen. By that time, his dreams for stardom were first emerging and he decided to moved to Atlanta to live with his sister. There he studied theatre at the&nbsp;North Atlanta School of Performing Arts.</p><p>Today, RuPaul has an impressive thirteen studio albums under his&nbsp; belt. But what most people don't know is that Ru first dipped his toe in the music business as a frontman in a punk rock concert. Dubbed 'Wee-Wee Pole', the band <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gigged across Atlanta</a> in the late 80's, performing for small crowds in alternative queer clubs like Club 688, and The Nitery,&nbsp;Atlanta Eagle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charles made his first television appearance around this time&nbsp;on a public access&nbsp;program called&nbsp;The American Music Show. Produced by Dick Richards, the show was&nbsp;the first of its kind in the realm of early queer television, so it's only fitting that Ru made several guest appearance.</p><p>During his 2018 Emmy acceptance speech, when RuPaul's Drag Race won its first award for Outstanding Reality Competition, Ru honored the recently past producer for jumpstarting his career.</p><p>"I’d love to thank Dick Richards&nbsp;who introduced me to Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey," Ru said, mentioning the producers of the now worldwide sensation.</p><p>Ru packed his bags and moved to the Big Apple in 1987. While he had a couple stints as a go-go dancer - even appearing on MTV's The Gong Show - Ru truly made a name for himself when he donned a pair of high heels&nbsp;and began his career as a drag queen. He made quite the name for himself as a prominent fixture of the city's nightlife scene, even being crown "The Queen of Manhattan". RuPaul got his first&nbsp;taste of national exposure as when he appeared in the B-52's music video Love Shack. The video was an instant hit, snagging the accolade of Best Group Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1990.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=supermodel-of-the-world>Supermodel of the World</h2><p>Just three years later, RuPaul would officially take the world by storm by releasing his first studio album Supermodel of World. The music video for his first single&nbsp;Supermodel (You Better Work!) featured Ru in full drag, parading across the NYC. Though the 90's was the time of grunge bands, the song was a massive hit, getting a shoutout from Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain as his favorite song of the year.</p><p>A year later, Charles saw another big break when he was given a modeling contract to be the face of MAC Cosmetics's VIVAGLAM, a campaign which gave proceeds to fight the emerging AIDS epidemic of the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"People thought we were absolutely crazy at a time when other brands were using Elizabeth Hurley and Isabella Rossellini," MAC co-founder&nbsp;Frank Toskan told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">National Post</a>, "We wanted spokespeople with characteristics, not necessarily beauty."</p><p>His star power continued to grow as he was given his own talk show on VH1. The RuPaul Show&nbsp;lasted for two season showcases Ru's skills as an entertainment personality as he sat down with such legends as Diana Ross, Beau Arthur, and Dionne Warwick.</p><p>By the end of the 90's, Ru had released two more studio albums, Foxy Lady and his Christmas album Ho, Ho, Ho. He also made several appearance on the big screen, most notably The Brady Bunch Movie, To Wong Fu! Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar, and But I'm A Cheerleader.</p><h2 id=the-phenomenon-of-rupaul-s-drag-race>The Phenomenon of RuPaul's Drag Race</h2><p>Entering into the 2000's, Ru decided to take a step back from the spotlight and take time for himself. Current events in the world made him feel apprehensive of continuing the upwards trajectory of his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Post-9/11, there was a hostile fear that had taken over the country.&nbsp;When that happened, anything to do with gender or sexual exploration went way underground," he lamented to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, "So I decided I would step away from the canvas, so to speak, in terms of show business."</p><p>Ru was rarely seen outside of his home aside from the occasional bar gigs he'd appear at to pay bills. But all that changed in 2009. Enter RuPaul's Drag Race.</p><p>Produced by World of Wonder, the first season of the now iconic show featured a low budget competition show in which nine queens from across the country battled it out to win $10,000 and the title of America's Next Drag Superstar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We thought, 'Everyone is ready for drag — it's mainstream now," the show's producer&nbsp;Fenton Bailey told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>.</p><p>And ready the world was as the show has made massive growth throughout its thirteen consecutive years on air. With 19 American season (including 6 All Star seasons), a plethora of international spin offs, a raise grand prize of $100,000, and a whopping eight Emmy awards, RuPaul's Drag Race has become one of the most buzzed about shows across the globe.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="15 Secrets You Didn't Know About RuPaul's Drag Race" href=#>15 Secrets You Didn't Know About RuPaul's Drag Race</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Far Out Magazine</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">National Post</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2FtrzArqNmm5iWv62x0maqraeirnqlvsCgZKuZk5p8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sauli-koskinen-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-623038-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sauli Koskinen Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
