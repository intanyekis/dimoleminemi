He has had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his children</a> do great things over the years and has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">changed a lot</a> since breaking out of Liverpool in the 60s. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything he touches</a> is valuable, and at this point, he is quite possibly the most accomplished musician we will see in this lifetime.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Due to having an immense amount of success for the better part of 6 decades, Paul McCartney has a staggering net worth that has exceeded $1 billion! It was a long and winding road to get here, but he is sitting on top and looking pretty.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Today, we are going to take a look at Paul McCartney and his incredible net worth, showing just how he made it possible!</span></p><h2 id=the-beatles-and-beyond>The Beatles And Beyond</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>To get an understanding of Paul McCartney and his immense net worth, it is important to shine a light on his time in The Beatles. Not only that, but it is also important to look at his other accomplishments in the music industry, as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Beatles are the biggest musical act in history, and long before the streaming era allowed for artists to have every single song on the Hot 100 at once, the group did things the old fashioned way. Despite not having a new album since the 70s, the group continues to be one of the best-selling acts in the world on an annual basis. It is estimated that the group has sold <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over 600 million albums</a> over the decades! This number seems almost impossible, especially considering that the music industry has changed so much since the 60s.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>While that group was a huge financial blessing for McCartney, he has also done quite a bit with other musical acts like Wings and even his solo music. His post-Beatles band, Wings, would sell an impressive 14 million albums, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Salon</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. This is more than enough for many bands, but it was just another project for McCartney.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Of course, McCartney is quite the accomplished solo artist, and he had a ton of hits back in his prime. It is estimated that he sold over 15 million albums as a solo performer just in the United States alone, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Omaha</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. This was only a small fraction of everything that helped him become a billionaire.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is The Richest Beatle (& Each Of Their Net Worth)</a></span></p><h2 id=his-real-estate-ventures>His Real Estate Ventures</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Music may be the biggest way that Paul McCartney was able to expand his massive net worth, but it certainly wasn’t the only way. In fact, the former Beatle has done quite well for himself in the world of real estate by acquiring a number of properties over the years.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Few people on the planet can lay claim to having the type of real estate that Paul McCartney does, and this is certainly helping his net worth. It is estimated that McCartney has over $100 million worth of real estate around the world, according to Celebrity Net Worth. In fact, it is possible that all of his real estate holdings tally up to $150 million, which is an unthinkable number for many people.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Some of his most notable properties are in his native&nbsp;England, including a 1,500-acre estate in Sussex. He is said to have other properties in the country, potentially holding over half a dozen, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Celebrity Net Worth</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In the states, McCartney has a little bit of everything under the sun. He has places in New York and even in Arizona, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Celebrity Net Worth. </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>Not just that, but he once owned Courtney Love’s former home <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in Beverly Hills</a>.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>A rock star like Paul McCartney needs to be able to sprawl out and relax after touring and making music, and it seems like he has picked a great spot or four to do so. This is another piece of his net worth, but it’s not the last one that we will be touching on.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ Is The Best Beatles’ Album</a></span></p><h2 id=invest-invest-invest>Invest, Invest, Invest</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>While selling hundreds of millions of albums and having over $100 million in real estate holdings is impressive, it is certainly not the only way that Paul McCartney has become a billionaire. The man has his hands in many pots, and he has dabbled in investing as time has gone on.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>CrunchBase</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Paul McCartney has done some investing over the years, most notably making a huge splash back in 2014. During that year, McCartney would invest over $27 million in Jaunt, the software developer. This was no small sum of money, and it showed that McCartney was willing to make a huge splash in something he felt could enhance his riches.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aside from the endeavors that we have touched on, McCartney also makes a ton of money from&nbsp;going on tour. He is still selling out some of the biggest venues around the world, as his name still holds an incredible amount of weight and power in the music industry.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All The Cars The Beatles Have Owned (And Where They Are Now)</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sir Paul’s $1 billion net worth isn’t going anywhere soon, and it will be interesting to see how much more he can rake in.
