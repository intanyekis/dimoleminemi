We both come from such different backgrounds that I think it took us a while to find some common ground. But once the walls came down and our inner goofballs began to reveal themselves, we were unstoppable, and now it's almost like we speak our own language. I've learned from Lili that the true value of a friend lies within their ability to listen. A good listener goes a long way." The friendship bond between these beauties obviously runs very deep.</p><h2 id=camila-guest-starred-in-madelaine-s-halloween-youtube-video><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Camila Guest Starred In Madelaine's Halloween YouTube Video</span></h2><p>Due to <a href=#>COVID-19 restrictions</a>, Camila Mendes and Madelaine Petsch were not able to go out and party for Halloween.

That is obviously the case for Madelaine Petsch, Camila Mendes, and Lili Rinehart who were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted out in Vancouver walking their dogs together</a>. They are&nbsp;all dog moms so they can easily relate when it comes to knowing how much responsibility comes along with taking care of a dog. A lot of time, energy, and effort go into taking care of puppies but these three beauties turn it into a bonding experience.</p><h2 id=lili-guest-starred-in-madelaine-s-tie-dye-youtube-video><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lili&nbsp;Guest Starred In Madelaine's&nbsp;Tie-Dye YouTube Video</span></h2><p>Madelaine added a new YouTube video to her channel with Lili Reinhart as the guest star.

Friends push each other to leave their comfort zones, and Camila has definitely encouraged me to come out of my shell in social situations. She's a social butterfly and I'm more introverted. It's a good balance." Friends do encourage each other to be their best selves. They seem to be a great match.</p><h2 id=lili-camila-amp-madelaine-dressed-up-as-the-powerpuff-girls><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lili, Camila, & Madelaine Dressed Up As The Powerpuff Girls</span></h2><p>The friendship between this trio couldn't be more obvious. They posed together as <a href=#>The Powerpuff Girls</a> and it was seriously the cutest thing ever. The reason this costume works so well is that the Powerpuff Girls characters share the same hair colors as the trip. Bubbles is a blonde, just like Lili Reinhart. Blossom is a redhead, just like Madelaine Petsch. Buttercup is a brunette, just like Camila Mendes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lili-camila-amp-madelaine-attend-parties-together><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lili, Camila, & Madelaine&nbsp;Attend Parties Together</span></h2><p>Lili Reinhart, Camila Mendes, and Madelaine Petsch were pictured in attendance at The Oscar's Afterparty at the beginning of 2020.

Everything is so new for both of us, and we're so lucky to be able to experience the chaos together.
