His Documentary On Reddit, Where Is He Now? All Facts The Talks Today</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Jerry Selbee and Marge Selbee, a retired couple from Michigan, found this out when they found a mistake in a state lottery game and are now millionaires because of it.</strong></p><p>The documentary Jerry and Marge Go Large, which came out on June 27 on Paramount Plus and is based on the true story of a couple who won the lottery, has made people curious about the real Jerry Selbee and whether or not he is still alive.</p><p>Even though the Selbees won more than $26 million in the lottery, they have never been arrogant. Instead, they put the money toward fixing up their house and helping their grandchildren and great-grandchildren pay for school.</p><p id=caption-attachment-34689 class=wp-caption-text>Jerry and Merge Selbee</p><h2 id=who-is-real-life-jerry-selbee-from-jerry-and-marge-go-large><span id=Who_Is_Real-Life_Jerry_Selbee_from_Jerry_and_Marge_Go_Large>Who Is Real-Life Jerry Selbee from Jerry and Marge Go Large?</span></h2><p>Jerry Selbee lives in a small rural town in Michigan called Evart, where there are only about 2,000 people. He and his wife, Marge, who he met in high school, have been living together and running a small store on Evart Street.</p><p>Jerry is in charge of the rare liquor and cigars, and Marge is in charge of the book store and sandwiches. They’ve been keeping an eye on the store for nearly 20 years. The Selbees raised six kids together. A local person says, “They are the most humble people you’ll ever meet.”</p><p>Also, Jerry, who sometimes goes by the name Gerald, is a normal old man who lives happily with his wife in the country, far from the toxicity of the city. Before getting his bachelor’s degree in math from Western Michigan University, he went to Athens High School in East Leroy Township. Everything is normal except for the fact that his brain is so good at math that it’s easy for him to solve very hard problems.</p><h2 id=jerry-selbee-age-revealed><span id=Jerry_Selbee_Age_Revealed>Jerry Selbee Age Revealed</span></h2><p>Gerald “Jerry” Selbee was born in 1939, which makes him 83 years old right now. He is now a grandfather and lives in Michigan with his wife Merge, where they are both retired.</p><p>Selbee had dyslexia as a child, which made it hard for Jerry to read fluently. On the other hand, Jerry was born with the math skills of a genius. In the seventh grade, he found out that he was very good at math.</p><p>Also, Jerry is crazy about puzzles. Puzzles, codes, and patterns are all things he does every day. Even as a lowly materials analyst at Kellogg’s, he was able to figure out how the American cereal industry worked. “Nothing you’ve learned in your life goes to waste,” says a proverb. So there you have it. Jerry found a way to get around the rules of the lottery by using his math skills. He did this by finding a loophole.</p><h2 id=jerry-and-marge-go-large-documentary-on-reddit><span id=Jerry_and_Marge_Go_Large_Documentary_on_Reddit>Jerry and Marge Go Large Documentary on Reddit</span></h2><p>Jerry and Marge Selbee won millions of dollars in the Michigan and Massachusetts lotteries after figuring out that a certain game, when played correctly, had a positive expected value.</p><p>When Jerry went back to the corner store one morning in 2003, he saw a flyer for a brand-new lottery game called Winfall. Jerry has always had what he calls “a head for math.” Within minutes, he realized that this was a game like no other.</p><p>In the beginning of the trailer for Jerry and Marge Go Large, Jerry has a “eureka!” moment while he is studying how to play the lottery. Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad plays Jerry in the movie, and Annette Bening, who won an Oscar, plays Merge Selbee.</p><h2 id=jerry-selbee-current-whereabouts-dead-or-alive><span id=Jerry_Selbee_Current_Whereabouts_Dead_or_Alive>Jerry Selbee Current Whereabouts, Dead or Alive</span></h2><p>Jerry Selbee, who won a million dollars in the lottery, is still alive and well. He and his wife are now enjoying retirement in Michigan.</p><p>Right now, they have six children and a few grandchildren. Their names haven’t been made public, though. Even though they won millions of dollars in the lottery, the Seabees kept living simply and used their money well.</p><p>They also used the money they won from the lottery to start a company that helps pay for building homes for war veterans in Northern Michigan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiuoaddnsButsSrqbJlo5q5o7HEZp%2Biq12ZvKTBzJ6lrZmirnqwuoydpqaZmaOscnyMsJ%2BeqpVitrR5x55kp6enYq6tuIyfmJyso2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./abu-salah-musa.html>&#171;&nbsp;Abu Salah Musa</a>
