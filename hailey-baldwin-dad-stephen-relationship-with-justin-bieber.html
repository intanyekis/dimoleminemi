Does Stephen Andrew Baldwin, Hailey Bieber's dad, agree with this statement? Stephen Baldwin has worked as an actor, producer, and director. Having appeared in the films Born on the Fourth of July, Posse, Threesome, The Usual Suspects, and The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, he has made a name for himself in the industry. Now fans are wondering: What does Stephen Baldwin think of his daughter's relationship with Justin Bieber?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Hailey and Justin Bieber have been married for over four years</a>, and their relationship never fails to make fans swoon. But while it might seem all sunshine and roses for the couple, Hailey and Justin revealed that wasn't always the case, especially at the beginning of their marriage. Justin started dating Hailey back in 2016. <a href=#>Initially, the two split but later rekindled their relationship</a>. Here is what Stephen Baldwin really thinks about Justin Bieber and Hailey's relationship.</p><h2 id=how-is-justin-bieber-39-s-relationship-with-hailey-39-s-dad-stephen-baldwin>How Is Justin Bieber's Relationship With Hailey's Dad, Stephen Baldwin?</h2><p>Anyone who has followed Hailey Bieber over the years knows she has a reputation for being religious. Justin Bieber, on the other hand, not so much. Justin's wife just shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview she recorded with actress Yvonne Orji</a> on her YouTube page. The two stars sat down for a talk about attempting to negotiate, hanging on to their religious convictions while working in the entertainment world. Hailey revealed that she often sees comments on social media that she believes may be highly judgemental and can come from fans with the same Christian background.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Justin & Hailey Bieber’s Health Issues Have Impacted Their Relationship</a></span></p><p>"I've met Christian people that are just super judgmental and made me feel like I'm a bad person because I don't live my life the way they think I should live my life," she said as she spoke to Yvonne. The model added, "I felt weird about posting certain photos of myself or feeling like, 'People in the church are gonna see this. Am I doing something wrong? Am I setting a bad example?'"</p><p>While defending herself from critics, Baldwin also revealed that their faith is the most significant part of her relationship with Bieber. Hailey said: "They ask me all the time, 'What would you say is the biggest thing in your relationship? You guys are really happy.' And I'm like, 'It's our faith.' It's what we believe in. If we didn't have that, we wouldn't even be here. We wouldn't even be together."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As religion is vital in Hailey's family, Stephen Baldwin appreciates Justin's respect for their traditions. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, "Stephen appreciated the respect that Justin has shown him as Hailey's father. It sounds old-fashioned, but it's a sign of respect. Justin and Hailey are very traditional when it comes to those things, and Stephen, of course, is, as well."</p><h2 id=is-justin-bieber-very-religious>Is Justin Bieber Very Religious?</h2><p>While Hailey Baldwin has a strong Christian element within her, it appears that Justin Bieber may not be near as religious. It was only in 2020 when an incident occurred, leaving fans across the globe stunned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Were Justin And Hailey Bieber Really Chaste Before Marriage?</a></span></p><p>According to a source that talked with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun Magazine</a>, Bieber had called her ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez while the Pandemic had the world under lockdown. The source revealed that Bieber complained to Gomez about Hailey, and it just so happened that Bieber discussed the religious element of his wife with his ex-girlfriend. According to the insider, Justin believed in God and even sees himself as religious, so much so that he shares a very close relationship with Hillsong pastor Carl Lentz. However, Bieber still feels that Hailey needs to chill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-justin-bieber-made-peace-with-his-past>Has Justin Bieber Made Peace With His Past?</h2><p>Hailey's live interview with Hillsong Church's Youtube Channel showed why Bieber may have negatively influenced his wife; it wasn't until the two talked to Vogue that even more interesting details came up. The couple showed no hesitation in revealing that Baldwin denied sleeping with Bieber until they married.</p><p>Bieber talked about it while the discussion revolved around his past issues with sex and drugs. He made it clear that he was interested in the perks of redirecting himself to God by marrying Hailey. The singer revealed, "I really felt it was better for the condition of my soul... And I believe that God blessed me with Hailey as a result. There are perks. You get rewarded for good behavior."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following this, he also discussed his drug issues and that the couple almost fell out because of it. Considering Hailey's overly religious past, it becomes apparent that Justin's experiences with drugs and sex may not have positively impacted his wife.</p><p>After saying that he had a legitimate problem with sex, Bieber revealed some even more interesting details about his past. "I found myself doing things that I was so ashamed of, being super-promiscuous and stuff, and I think I used Xanax because I was so ashamed," he said as he recalled those memories during the interview.</p><p>Although things are better now for Justin Bieber regarding his drug usage, he almost hinted that his wife had to put in all the effort to bring the two to where they are now. Meanwhile, <a href=#>Hailey's dad seems to adore Justin and respect their relationship</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Do Justin And Hailey Bieber Plan On Having Kids?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqGcmsZursClm7ChnmKxorCMrKueqJiau26%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mrqKsmGK3tr%2FToqVmmpmar6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kendall-jenners-friends-want-reunite-devin-booker-bad-bunny-couldnt-commit.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kendall Jenners Friends Wants Her To Reunite With Devin Booker After Bad Bunny Couldnt Commit</a>
