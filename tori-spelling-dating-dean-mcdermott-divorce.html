"They also made an effort to make holidays and milestones special, and were much more in tune with each other.

But when that time came, Spelling found someone to have fun with. That person is Cramer.</p><p>Cramer is an ad executive and CEO of the advertising agency Neuron Syndicate Inc.

This was clear given that McDermott was linked to Lily Calo weeks before, if not longer, Spelling and Cramer debuted their romance.</p><p>McDermott and Calo were first spotted together as they held hands walking up to the Department of Social Services in October 2023; <a href=#>Spelling found her ex's new relationship to be "disrespectful" to the state of the relationship between herself and McDermott</a>.

So happy, in fact, that McDermott had no problem discussing Spelling's PDA with her new beau as well as the type of person Spelling is in relationships.</p><p>"Tori as a person is a beautiful, kind and loving soul," McDermott explained to Daily Mail.

However, given that the two were together for 17 years before going through the motions to divorce and that they have five children together, it is entirely possible they may try to rekindle their relationship.
