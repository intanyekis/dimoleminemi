The Truth Behind the Snake Sannins Fate</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Orochimaru is one of the most notorious and mysterious characters in the Naruto series. He is a former ninja of Konohagakure, who became a rogue and a criminal mastermind, seeking immortality and the secrets of the world. He is also one of the legendary Sannin, along with Jiraiya and Tsunade, who were trained by the Third Hokage. But what happened to him after the events of Naruto Shippuden? Is he still alive, or did he finally meet his end? This article will explore the possible scenarios and evidence regarding Orochimaru’s fate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Orochimaru’s Background and Motivations</h2><p>Orochimaru was orphaned at a young age, when his parents were killed by enemy ninjas. He grew up with a thirst for power and knowledge, and a disregard for human life. He became a prodigy in the ninja arts, and joined the Sannin, who were hailed as heroes of the Second Shinobi World War. However, Orochimaru soon became fascinated by the dark and forbidden aspects of ninjutsu, and began to conduct unethical experiments on humans and animals, in order to learn new techniques and extend his lifespan. He also developed a desire to learn all the abilities of the world, especially the ones possessed by the Uchiha clan and the First Hokage.</p><p>Orochimaru’s ambitions led him to betray Konoha and join the Akatsuki, a criminal organization that sought to capture the tailed beasts. However, he soon left the Akatsuki as well, after failing to take Itachi Uchiha’s body as his new vessel. He then founded his own hidden village, Otogakure, where he gathered loyal followers and continued his experiments. He also targeted Sasuke Uchiha, the younger brother of Itachi, who had the potential to awaken the Sharingan and the Rinnegan, the two most powerful eye techniques in the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Orochimaru’s Ending Choices and Consequences</h2><p>Orochimaru’s actions brought him into conflict with many characters in the series, especially Naruto Uzumaki, the main protagonist, and his friends. Orochimaru was responsible for many atrocities, such as killing the Third Hokage, invading Konoha, kidnapping Sasuke, killing Jiraiya, and resurrecting the previous Hokages. He also clashed with his former allies, such as Kabuto Yakushi, who became his rival and successor, and the Akatsuki, who hunted him down for his betrayal.</p><p>Orochimaru’s fate was ultimately decided by his own student, Sasuke, who had a complicated relationship with him. Sasuke initially joined Orochimaru, hoping to gain enough power to kill Itachi and avenge his clan. However, after learning the truth about Itachi and his mission, Sasuke turned against Orochimaru and killed him, absorbing his power and freeing himself from his influence. Sasuke then used Orochimaru’s technique, the Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation, to revive the previous Hokages and learn the history of the ninja world. He also revived Orochimaru himself, using a piece of his chakra that was left in Anko Mitarashi, one of his former test subjects. Sasuke then allied with Orochimaru and his former teammates, Naruto, Sakura, and Kakashi, to stop the war and defeat the final enemies, Madara Uchiha and Kaguya Otsutsuki.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Orochimaru’s Post-Game Status and Speculations</h2><p>After the war ended, and peace was restored, Orochimaru’s status and whereabouts became unknown. He was pardoned by Kakashi, the Sixth Hokage, for his help in the war, and was allowed to roam free, under the surveillance of Yamato, a Konoha ninja who had the Wood Release ability. Orochimaru also continued his research, and created two clones of himself, named Mitsuki and Log, who he considered his sons. He also maintained contact with Sasuke, who occasionally visited him for information.</p><p>Orochimaru’s fate is still unclear, as he has not appeared in the Boruto series, which is the sequel to Naruto. However, he is still alive, as confirmed by his son Mitsuki, who is one of the main characters in Boruto. Mitsuki is a ninja of Konoha, who is a member of Team 7, along with Boruto Uzumaki, the son of Naruto, and Sarada Uchiha, the daughter of Sasuke. Mitsuki has inherited some of Orochimaru’s abilities, such as the snake-like form and the regeneration power. He also has a strong bond with Boruto, who he considers his sun.</p><p>The most plausible explanation for Orochimaru’s fate is that he is still alive, and still pursuing his goals, albeit in a more discreet and subtle way. He might have also changed his attitude, and become more tolerant and cooperative, as he has shown signs of remorse and gratitude for his former enemies and allies. He might have also developed a genuine affection for his sons, and a curiosity for the new generation of ninjas. However, he might still have some hidden agendas, and some secrets that he has not revealed yet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Orochimaru is a character that has left a lasting impression on the fans and the industry, and his story is one of the most intriguing and controversial in the series. Whether he is a villain or an anti-hero, a friend or a foe, a father or a monster, Orochimaru is a character that cannot be easily defined or forgotten. He is a character that has challenged the morals and values of the protagonists, and has shown the complexity and diversity of the ninja world. Orochimaru is a character that has died and revived, and has transcended the boundaries of life and death. He is a character that has asked the question: “is Orochimaru dead?”, and has answered it with his own actions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBuu9GomqGhnZa%2FtnnDnpidZaSdsm7A0a6roWWSmrWqusNmq6GdXai7orfEZqqapp6eu7R5xZqrnmc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jeff-kent-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jeff Kent Net Worth | TheRichest</a>
