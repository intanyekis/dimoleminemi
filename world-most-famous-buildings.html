However, because of many reasons, such as being burned down bad circumstances and earthquakes, the ancient cathedral has been reconstructed many times since.

Most recognized for its lean, the tower started to tilt during construction after soft ground on one side was inadequate to properly bear the weight of the structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to reconstruction work carried out in 2001, the tower currently leans at just under 4 degrees. It is estimated that it will fall in the next 75-100 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Building work on the tower started in 1173 and continued for over a huge 300 years.
