John Legend sang "Happy Birthday," so honestly, it doesn't seem like it can get much better than that!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aston-martin-db9---200-000>Aston Martin DB9 - $200,000</h2><p>Kim Kardashian is no stranger to luxury cars, as you'll find out later, and she owns so many that this list could probably be comprised of vehicles alone. The Aston Martin DB9 is famous for its role in the James Bond series, and is the sleek and chic choice of many a rich celebrity.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Crazy Things The Kardashians Have Bought Their Kids</a></span></p><p>Kardashian's model cost around $200,000, and it's said to be in her and West's possession in their tricked-out garage of expensive cars.</p><h2 id=rolls-royce-phantom---407-000>Rolls Royce Phantom - $407,000</h2><p>Kardashian purchased the new Rolls Royce Phantom in 2015 to the tune of $407,000, but she didn't stop there. Before she took her new car home, the star had it customized with matte silver paint, new rims, and tinted windows.</p><p>The work was done by Platinum Motorsport, a favorite business of the family, and Kardashian was spotted driving the vehicle solo, returning home in workout clothes.

The two decided to add some glam to their already luxurious bathroom by dropping a cool $750,000 on four gold-plated toilet seats, and though they aren't as expensive as the one pictured above, we bet they look pretty similar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they aren't the first to splurge on golden toilets, it's no secret that the famous family has more than enough spare cash to purchase expensive things. That really gives a new meaning to "porcelain throne!"</p><h2 id=lamborghini-aventador-lp-700-4---750-000>Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 - $750,000</h2><p>Another gift for then-boyfriend Kanye, Kim K purchased this beautiful (and pricey) Lamborghini Aventador in 2012, just in time for West's 35th birthday.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Things Kanye West Owns</a></span></p><p>The black luxury Lambo was delivered to Platinum Motorsports ahead of Kanye's big day and came with a hefty $750,000 price tag. Some may think that Kanye is the better gift giver in the relationship, but Kim has definitely delivered her fair share of surprises as we can see!</p><h2 id=savoir-royal-state-beds---1-million>Savoir Royal State Beds - $1 million</h2><p>Another addition to their Bel-Air mansion, Kim and Kanye decided that they need the most expensive night's sleep possible, spending just over $1 million on 6 Savoir Royal State beds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These beds are absolutely insane! They take around 700 hours to craft, and are produced from cashmere, lamb's wool, and Mongolian horse hair. The design is based upon 17th and 18th century beds, and purchasers can even choose to stitch a family crest into the mattress. In addition to the Kardashian-Wests, Madonna, Oprah, and Elton John also enjoy their own royal slumber in these sought-after beds. The beds were part of a limited run of 60 units to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation.</p><h2 id=swarovski-encrusted-fridge---1-million>Swarovski Encrusted Fridge - $1 million</h2><p>As if their Bel-Air house didn't already have enough expensive amenities, Kim K is at it again with her special edition Swarovski encrusted fridge-freezer combo. The reported value of the appliance is around $1 million, and the doesn't include the other appliances she also purchased to complete the kitchen.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Member of The Kardashian Family's Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kardashian must have an affinity for expensive ice-related purchases, as she and ex-husband Kris Humphries had a set of $260 ice tongs listed on their wedding registry. At least those are a bit more affordable than Swarovski!</p><h2 id=hidden-hills-mansion---20-million>Hidden Hills Mansion - $20 million?</h2><p>And, because they can, the Kardashian-West family decided not to move into their Bel-Air mansion after all and instead purchased this $20 million home in Hidden Hills near Calabasas. The 8 bedroom, 10 bathroom house used to be owned by Lisa Marie Presley, and also boasts two pools and two vineyards.</p><p>Though the purchase price was allegedly around $20 million, momager Kris Jenner clapped back at reports of the house's worth, claiming that it was now valued at $60 million after renovations. Whether or not that is accurate remains to be seen, but it is a lovely home either way.</p><h2 id=nyc-airbnb---30-million>NYC Airbnb - $30 million</h2><p>Only Kim K could stay in an Airbnb worth more than her own mansion. When the starlet decided to travel to New York City for a month long trip away from the West Coast, Airbnb did not play around and hooked her up with a five bedroom, six bathroom penthouse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With 7,200 square feet of space, the family definitely had room to move. There were even seven outdoor terraces, perfect for outdoor time. Kardashian has revealed that the stay was complimentary, but we think that the price tag on this amazing pad is too insane not to include on the list.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>24 Surprising Ways The Kardashians Make Money</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWacsaiVo8CqwsRmp66bmJbApr%2BO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./angelina-jolie-ex-husband-jonny-lee-miller-billy-bob-thornton-relationship-now.html>&#171;&nbsp;Angelina Jolie's Ongoing Relationships With Her First Two Husbands Is Downright Confusing</a>
