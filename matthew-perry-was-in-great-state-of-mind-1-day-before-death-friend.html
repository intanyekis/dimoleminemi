href=#>Matthew Perry</a>’s friend <strong>Athenna Crosby</strong> spent time with the beloved actor <a href=#>just one day before his <span class=s1>apparent drowning </span></a><span class=s2><i>—</i></span> and she exclusively tells <i>Us Weekly</i> that the <i>Friends</i> star was looking forward to his “second act” before his untimely death.</p><p class=p1>“He was talking the whole time and was super excited to be hanging out,” Crosby, 25, exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i>, noting they met through a mutual pal. “It was great. He was in a good state of mind and talking about his life and <a href=#>sharing with me funny stories</a> about his time in the industry.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “He was talking about how excited he was to have a second act and had struggles that inhibited his acting aspirations but had turned it all around and was looking forward to getting back into it full swing.”</p><p class=p1>According to Crosby, she had not known Perry for very long. Their Friday, October 27, lunch outing at the Hotel Bel-Air was the second time<a href=#> they met up in person.</a> While she admitted that Perry was “so private,” he had been open about his past struggles. (Perry long <a href=#>struggled with addiction</a>, even going to rehab twice.)</p><p class=p1>“He was very healthy and talking about how he was <a href=#>looking forward to hitting the pickleball court</a> and how he had gotten very into it,” Crosby, a model and former beauty queen, told <i>Us. “</i>He was telling me I needed to try it and it was fun. He said he was losing weight and getting in shape. … He was in a positive place and doing so good [and] was being extra healthy.”</p><p class=p1>Perry even told Crosby that <a href=#>he had “really come back strong from” his struggles</a> with alcohol. “He said for a lot of years he was lost in the addiction and how he fully came out on the other side,” she recalled. “He was clean and didn’t order a drink. In fact, he didn’t even want a drink menu. He was <a href=#>taking all the temptation out</a> of his life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Matthew-Perry-s-Cause-of-Death-Revealed-653.jpg><p class=p1>News broke one day later on Saturday, October 28, that <a href=#>Perry had died at the age of 54</a>. According to multiple reports, local law enforcement officers <a href=#>responded to a cardiac arrest call</a> at Perry’s Los Angeles home. The actor was found unresponsive in a hot tub when the police arrived. The county’s medical examiner later confirmed on Sunday, October 29, that <a href=#>Perry had died on the scene</a>. A cause of death <a href=#>has not been revealed</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I was shocked. I had to hear it from the news first. <a href=#>I thought it was so devastating</a>,” Crosby recalled of finding out that Perry had died. “At the time, I had to pull [my car] over and read it and ask myself if it was true. <a href=#>It’s so disturbing</a> because I had just spoken to him hours before he passed.”</p><p class=p1>During their final conversation, Crosby noted that Perry seemed “normal and fine.” She reiterated: “He was such a good person.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Our <a href=#>special issue</a> dedicated to Matthew Perry is available now.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Andrea Simpson</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSptabDjKmcq6qpYsSiv4yipWafopqutXnSrZitnV2ks265yKebZmldma66ecGenaiqlWKxpq3ToWSfqpmau6V7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alec-baldwin-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alec Baldwin Bio (Wiki)</a>
