Let's found out.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-headlined-coachella-2022>Harry Styles Headlined Coachella 2022</h2><p>Coachella is easily one of the biggest music events of the year, so much that hearts were quite literally broken when the annual festival was canceled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, Coachella was back in action this year and the festival featured an array of big names, including British heartthrob, Harry Styles. The singer headlined the weekend of April 16, and it turned out to be quite the show. Not only did the 'As It Was' singer showcase a few new tunes from his upcoming album, but he also had a surprise guest.</p><p>During his performance, the instrumental to Shania Twain's 'Man! I Feel Like A Woman' blasted on the speakers, only to have the Canadian country star emerge on star shortly after. The duo sang a few tunes together, making for what could only be described as a Coachella night to remember.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-earned-39-way-more-39-than-big-sean>Harry Styles Earned 'Way More' Than Big Sean</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, many Coachella headliners were paid the big bucks. When Beyonce blessed the stage back in 2018, the singer earned herself between $8 to $12 million, while Ariana's 2019 performance scored her an $8 million check, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> reported.</p><p>While Harry Styles's exact earnings for his Coachella performance aren't public, it's safe to say he made himself a few million, too. Although we aren't sure how many millions, Harry earned a lot more than fellow festival performer, Big Sean.</p><p>There was quite a lot of controversy surrounding the matter after Big Sean revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Styles earned "way more" than the rapper did</a>, despite bringing in similar crowd sizes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Saweetie Suffers Wardrobe Malfunction On Stage At Coachella</a></span></p><p>In a since-deleted Instagram Stories post, Big Sean reposted a Coachella screenshot saying "Big Sean At Coachella Crowd Rivals Harry Styles’ Main Stage… Competing Headliners???”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Except he got paid way, way, way, way more than me,” Big Sean wrote in the post's caption. Yikes!</p><h2 id=the-weeknd-also-earned-big-bucks-for-his-coachella-appearance>The Weeknd Also Earned Big Bucks For His Coachella Appearance</h2><p>The Weeknd closed out the festival as the final headliner throwing in Swedish House Mafia into the mix, too! Well, this wasn't the original plan. When Coachella first announced its headliners, Kanye West was set to hit the stage, however, the Donda rapper had to step back to tend to his mental health.</p><p>The Weeknd was later <a href=#>announced as Ye's replacement</a>, however, it seems as if the Canadian artist wasn't too happy with how much he was being offered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye West was reportedly expected to make over $8 million for his appearance, which certainly lines up with past earnings for stars such as Bey and Ariana. Well, it seems as if the festival tried to pull a fast one on Abel and pay him less.</p><p>The 'Save Your Tears' singer was quite vocal regarding how much he believed he should be paid, even going as far as making his opinion public.</p><p>Abel said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wanted the festival organizers to match the $8.5 million</a> that Kanye West was allegedly meant to take home, making it clear he was offered less at first.</p><p>Considering The Weeknd is one of the hottest artists in the industry at the moment, it's no surprise that he wanted that fat check.</p><p>Now, while it remains unknown as to whether or not Coachella did, in fact, pay The Weeknd out a whopping $8.5 million, the rapper stuck to his word and performed the final set — so perhaps he did get his way after all.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's How Much Cardi B Earned For Performing At Coachella</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lmJa%2Fs8WMrKuypJWoeqat0adkn6eiYrCwrcKhnKWkkWQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jada-pinkett-smith-is-talking-about-writing-a-book-with-will-smith.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jada Pinkett Smith Is Talking About Writing a Book With Will Smith</a>
