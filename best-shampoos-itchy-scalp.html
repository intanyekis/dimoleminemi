Whether you have a scalp condition like psoriasis or just experience a bit of itching here and there, your shampoo choice can make a huge difference.</p><p>There are many shampoos for all different budgets that have been designed with itchy scalps in mind and it can be difficult to know which to choose. We’ve put together this list as a guide to the 11 best shampoos for an itchy scalp. Not only will it give you a number of great suggestions to help, but will also explain the ingredients and benefits of each product. We will also look at some of the key ingredients you should avoid.</p><p>With that being said, here are the 11 best shampoos for an itchy scalp.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Shampoo&nbsp;</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>This is the ultimate shampoo choice if you have an itchy scalp. While it’s been designed with men in mind, anyone with an itchy scalp could benefit from this effective product.</p><p>Most importantly, this Blu Atlas shampoo is a clean and gentle product, cutting out all of the harsh ingredients that are bad for our scalps. In fact, it is made of 99% natural ingredients, one of which is saw palmetto. This plant-based ingredient is great if you’re experiencing hair loss, but it is also fantastic for sensitive or inflamed scalps as it has natural anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>The formula also contains aloe vera, a deeply hydrating addition that is great for those experiencing dryness which can cause itching. Jojoba oil is another excellent addition for hydrating the skin, which is also full of vitamins to maintain the hair’s health. And, instead of using stripping ingredients like parabens or sulfates to create a foaming effect, this shampoo features surfactants made of coconut.</p><p>This shampoo comes in two scents; classic and coconut apricot. These are entirely natural as this product doesn’t contain any artificial fragrances – Blu Atlas chose to formulate their shampoo without chemical fragrances because they can be sensitizing for the skin and the scalp.</p><p>Still not convinced that this product will work for your itchy scalp? Well, the brand has its own medical advisory board composed of three professional dermatologists bringing all their extensive experience and knowledge to the product. In addition, this shampoo is vegan and cruelty-free, so everyone can enjoy this product with a clear conscience.</p><p>We know you’re going to love it, but in the rare circumstance it’s not for you, you can return it for your money back.</p><p>Try following up this shampoo with Blu Atlas Conditioner for even better results. Their conditioner is deeply hydrating and nourishing and, like the shampoo, it does not contain harmful ingredients and chemicals that can worsen your scalp problems.</p><p>For all these reasons, this is the top shampoo on our list of the 11 best shampoos for an itchy scalp.</p><h3>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Head & Shoulders Coconut Daily-Use Anti-Dandruff Shampoo</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>Head & Shoulders is a classic for a reason. A tried and true anti-dandruff shampoo, people with dry, itchy scalps rave about it. This particular product in the head and shoulders range is enriched with coconut milk to deeply hydrate and nourish the scalp. This prevents dryness and maintains scalp health. It also contains the powerhouse ingredient zinc pyrithione, which is great for dandruff control and prevents associated symptoms like itching and redness.</p><p>While the formula is powerful, it’s also gentle enough to be used daily. So, if you have issues with oil control or simply have hair on the thinner side that needs regular washing, this could be a great choice for you. This shampoo will clean your hair thoroughly but won’t strip the natural oils that keep your hair healthy.</p><p>If you’ve got a flaky, itchy scalp, you want a shampoo that will deliver real results, and that means a reduction in flakes and dryness. This Head & Shoulders shampoo will genuinely deliver, with a clinically proven reduction in dandruff.</p><p>When it comes to hair care, the ingredients that are left out can be just as important as those that are included. Stripping and drying ingredients like parabens can be a real problem for the scalp. Therefore, it’s good to know this shampoo is paraben free. Because this shampoo has a clean, gentle formula, it’s also safe for colored hair and suitable for all hair textures.</p><p>Many people with an itchy, flaky, or inflamed scalp may have an underlying condition. For instance, psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis are both associated with scalp itching. This product is suitable for people with these conditions, but speak to your dermatologist if you have any concerns about a health condition.</p><h3>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Briogeo Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>From Briogeo, this luxurious Scalp Revival shampoo is designed to completely refresh your dry, itchy scalp.</p><p>While the other selections on this list are primarily daily-use products, this micro-exfoliating shampoo is meant to be used once a week. It gives a deep, intensive clean to remove layers of grease and dirt. It also exfoliates the dry scalp, preventing itching and dandruff. This allows your everyday shampoo to work better and provides a “reset” for the week ahead.</p><p>This product is fantastic for itchy scalps, but don’t just take our word for it. Briogeo has undertaken studies which show that just one use reduces dandruff significantly. This is great for those suffering from scalp discomfort, as dandruff can be a leading cause of irritation. Additionally, this shampoo removes product buildup, which has been known to make itching even worse.</p><p>But how does this product work? One of the key active ingredients is charcoal, which helps to remove any impurities or toxins from the scalp. This, along with vegetable micro-exfoliators, are the secret to the deep cleaning power of this shampoo. It also features various essential oils, like tea tree, with natural healing products. On top of this, coconut oil provides moisture and hydration.</p><p>Even though this product packs a punch, it features many natural ingredients instead of harmful chemicals. This means it is safe for any hair concern, such as colored hair and hair with chemical treatments. Briogeo boasts being “6 free,” which means that this product does not contain six harmful ingredients that are often found in shampoos, including parabens, sulfates, and artificial dyes.</p><p>If this product works for you, why not try the rest of the Scalp Revival™ Scalp Soothing Solutions Set? This set features five different products, including masks and treatments, to really give your scalp the care it deserves.</p><h3>4. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Body Shop Ginger Scalp Care Shampoo&nbsp;</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>This vegan shampoo from The Body Shop features some of nature’s best ingredients for scalp care. It’s been featured in articles, magazines, and on the Today Show, heralded for its incredible formula. Not only that, but it’s also got the seal of approval from dermatologists.</p><p>It’s not always been easy to find vegan shampoos that leave the hair smooth and silky, however, this shampoo is a definite exception.</p><p>The secret to this fantastic product is a unique vegan form of silk protein that leaves your strands looking healthy and silky. It is also jam-packed with other natural ingredients that fortify the scalp. In fact, the formula is 90% natural.

Neutrogena’s T/Gel has long been recommended for managing psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and just ordinary dandruff.</p><p>This isn’t just a regular shampoo, it’s a medicated product that reduces irritation and skin shedding to treat flakes and itching. For this reason, it’s recommended by dermatologists.</p><p>The active ingredient in this shampoo is 0.5% coal tar. While this may seem like a strange addition to shampoo, coal tar is actually a type of skin and hair care ingredient, falling into a category called keratoplastics. Keratoplastics help to clear the scalp of dead skin cells and reduce cell turnover going forward, minimizing itching and discomfort.</p><p>One of the many great things about this shampoo is that it keeps working after your shower.

For instance, if you are already being treated for psoriasis or another condition, it is best to ask your dermatologist how to incorporate T/Gel into your routine.</p><p>Depending on your individual preferences and situation, you may want to use this shampoo daily or just once a week to renew and refresh your scalp.</p><h3>6. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Aveeno Skin Relief Soothing Shampoo</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>Known as one of the best shampoos for itchy scalps for years, Aveeno is well known for its skincare products aimed at sensitive skin. However, their shampoos are just as good, especially if you have an itchy or flaky scalp.</p><p>The Skin Relief Soothing Shampoo has a pH-balanced formula that is gentle enough even for the most sensitive scalps; it’s a great choice if you’ve struggled with reactions or flare-ups due to shampoos or soaps. Even if your scalp or hair cannot usually tolerate daily washes, this shampoo can be used frequently due to its mild formula. It’s also soap and fragrance-free, so perfect if you have any sensitivities. In general, this product is incredibly allergy friendly.</p><p>The magic ingredient in this shampoo is colloidal oatmeal. Oats are ground into a fine powder to produce this ingredient that deeply moisturizes the scalp. Colloidal oatmeal also restores and protects the natural health of the hair and scalp. In addition, the shampoo contains lemon balm, known for its calming properties. This is fantastic if your scalp tends to get irritated.</p><p>This shampoo is an excellent choice if you have fine or thin hair because it won’t cause product buildup or strip your hair of its natural oils. This means you can use it frequently, even daily, without causing scalp flare-ups or further damaging the hair.</p><p>If you want the best results from this product, try leaving it in for a few minutes before washing out. This will ensure you get the best results for your scalp and will also leave your hair soft and manageable.</p><h3>7. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Davines Naturaltech Calming Shampoo&nbsp;</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>This shampoo has been designed to soothe even the most irritated scalps, containing specialized ingredients called phytoceuticals.</p><p>Phytoceutical are plant-based compounds that have positive effects on the skin. They have been rigorously tested to ensure that they really work on your scalp to reduce any itching or discomfort.

In addition, coconut oil softens, and sugar kelp extract kills all the nasties that may lead to scalp irritation. Many anti-dandruff shampoos have unpleasant fragrances due to their active ingredients, but this shampoo has a lovely herb, vanilla, and floral fragrance that will leave your hair smelling fresh. These fragrance components are all natural—there’s no chemical or artificial fragrances here.</p><p>While this is a medicated, scientifically-formulated product, it doesn’t have harsh chemicals that may negatively affect your hair or scalp. For instance, it’s free of parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. This is especially important if you have any product sensitivities, as these ingredients can cause flare-ups.</p><p>With this product, it is probably best to start using it 3-4 times weekly and slowly build up. That being said, most people find it suitable for daily use. Therefore, it’s perfect for people who need to wash every day to keep their oil at bay.</p><p>But how long will it take to notice positive changes like reduced itching? Some customers have reported feeling and seeing the difference after only one or two washes. For others, it can take a couple of weeks. This really depends on your individual hair and scalp. However, if you’ve used the shampoo for a week or two and don’t love it, you can return it for a refund. Just make sure this is within 30 days of receiving the product.</p><h3>9. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sebamed Everyday Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair&nbsp;</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>Sebamed products are dermatologist-approved, medicinal skin and hair care products.
