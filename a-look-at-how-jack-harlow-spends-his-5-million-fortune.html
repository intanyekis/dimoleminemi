spends his riches on diamond jewelry and sneakers.</p><p>Hailing from Louisville, Kentucky, <a href=#>Jack Harlow was first introduced to hip-hop</a> by his mother and generated interest in rapping at 12. With his brother Clayborn, he began making mixtapes during high school before selling mixtapes in middle school. He performed at sold-out local shows with the group Moose Gang and ventured as a solo artist in 2015. Harlow made a breakthrough in 2020 with his single <i>Whats Popping</i> and earned a Grammy nomination. His debut album, <i>That’s What They All Say</i>, and the second album<i>, Come Home The Kids Miss You</i>, have made him famous worldwide. Along with his music, <a href=#>Harlow makes a sizable fortune from performing on tours with famous artists</a> and his brand endorsement with KFC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jack Harlow is a down-to-Earth and modest artist who enjoys the little things in life. While he keeps things private, a few facts are known about his expensive purchases. Let’s look at how Jack Harlow spends his riches, from diamonds to cool sneakers.</p><h2 id=a-splendid-jewelry-collection>A Splendid Jewelry Collection</h2><p>Following the trend of many established rappers in the industry, Jack Harlow has spent a sizable fortune on buying jewels. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HypeBeast</a>, he purchased a set of eight Private Championships diamond rings worth $110,000 designed by Alex Moss. Each ring is made from 18-carat white gold and weighs 55 grams. Harlow also has a necklace with a diamond-encrusted Kentucky map to pay homage to his state.

The first is the powerful and sleek Audi R8, an exotic sports car that reaches 60 MPH in just 3 seconds. It offers a wide array of functions and remains a favorite amongst A-list personalities. The second car is a five-seater Cadillac XT5. The automatic transmission makes it easier for everyday driving and has a mighty V6 engine to go from 0 to 60 MPH within 6.7 seconds.</p><h2 id=expensive-timepieces>Expensive Timepieces</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since gaining traction in 2020, Jack Harlow has made one expensive timepiece purchase with the Rolex Sky-Dweller. With an Oystersteel bracelet, it also has a white gold fluted bezel. The bright blue dial is eye-catching and sets him back by $15,200. The watch has been an all-time accessory for the rapper as he is seen wearing it at the 2022 Grammys, Met Gala, and his <i>Rolling Stone</i> interview, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Report</a>. Harlow aspires to grow his collection, but he is happy to have just a Sky-Dweller for now.</p><h2 id=sneakers>Sneakers</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jack Harlow has been loyal to New Balance from a young age, and it would not be easy to see the rapper wearing any other brand.

He wants his mother’s presence and believes that staying grounded is important despite traveling to different cities for work. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, rather than settling into his life in popular cities like Los Angeles or New York, Jack Harlow moved back to Kentucky to live in the same city as his parents. He stated that going without seeing his mother for weeks would be difficult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fashion>Fashion</h2><p>Jack Harlow has always brought his <a href=#>fashion A-Game to any red carpet</a> event and has shown his appealing street style through Instagram posts. A fan of timeless designs and tasteful colors, his go-to brand is Tommy Hilfiger. For the streets, he chooses eye-popping colors that match his different New Balance sneakers while he dresses in couture looks for any award shows, including his all-Hermès look at the 2022 VMA Awards.</p><h2 id=philanthropy>Philanthropy</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the beginning of his fame, Jack Harlow has always used his platform to raise awareness and help the ones who need it.
