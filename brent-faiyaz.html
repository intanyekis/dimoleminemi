His birth name is Christopher Brent Wood. However, somewhere along the line of his career, he adopted his stage name Brent Faiyaz and has become an icon with that name.</p><p>Brent's name first started to shine when he was featured on <i>Crew</i> by the <i>GoldLink</i>, which went on to become the 6x Platinum. This earned him a Grammy nomination for <i>Best Rap/Sung Collaboration</i>.</p><h2>Brent Faiyaz Relationship Status: Who Is His Wife?</h2><p>Brent Faiyaz has been actively dating Zahara Davis since 2019, an American Model. His girlfriend was born in Hawaii and starred in <i>Lanivatti's First Capsule Collection: Beyond Borders</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/imago0090133776s-1671606070262.jpg><p>There hasn't been any news of Brent and Zahara breaking up. So they have been together for more than two years and are still going strong. Many assume that they are married and have a daughter. However, this is still a mystery.</p><h3>Dating Rumor About Brent Faiyaz & Amber Olivier</h3><p>There was a rumor that Faiyaz might be dating Amber Olivier, a singer. It went viral after Brent posted a photo together with Amber. But the post was deleted after some days, which might have signaled that it was just a rumor and nothing more.</p><p>The post where Brent puts his hand around Amber's neck remains on her Instagram account. Although they never confirmed their relationship, they have gone on many tours together.</p><h2>Faiyaz Started Making Music At 12</h2><p>Standing at the height of 5 feet 11 inches (<strong>181cm</strong>), Faiyaz was born in Maryland, US, on September 19, 1995. In 2007, when he was just twelve, he started working to create music, but he didn't take it seriously back then.</p><p>As for Brent's parents, they didn't understand his career path. While Brent confirmed that he would be successful because of his love for music, his parents differed, saying that it distracted him.&nbsp;</p><h2>Net Worth & Earnings Of Brent Faiyaz&nbsp;</h2><p>Faiyaz claims to be the best R&B singer of his generation and the richest one. However, he is well known for exaggerating things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/GettyImages-1392695968-1671605448917.jpg><p>As per independent reports, Brent Faiyaz has a net worth of approximately <strong>$2 million</strong>, the same as the net worth of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Chelsea Kilgore</a>. He could have earned more than $20 million in the last half-decade, but he wasted it in exchange for his luxurious taste in things.</p><h2>Education Details</h2><p>Brent joined the public school in his hometown, Long Reach High School to complete his high school education.
