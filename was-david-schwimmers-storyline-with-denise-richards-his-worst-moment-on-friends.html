world of sitcoms during their run, they would also play a crucial role in paving the way for negotiations. Prior to Friends, it was more of a "every man for themselves" environment when it came to working out a deal. David Schwimmer ended up changing this, getting the cast together and opting for equal pay across the board. This was something he didn't need to do, especially given that he was going to be the highest paid member of the cast.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Spotted Matt LeBlanc And David Schwimmer's Crush On Jennifer Aniston In This 1994 BTS Moment</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The plan was well-received not only by the fans <a href=#>but by the cast as well.</a> “We’re all doing the exact same amount of work, I wouldn’t have felt comfortable knowing I was making more.”</p><p>Courteney Cox would add, “We all felt that way. I thought it was the most important thing—as we all did—that we all were equal in every single way. That was the first time that people had all stuck together in a cast. I think it was scary, probably, for productions after that.”</p><p>It was a great decision that Schwimmer took charge of. However, behind the scenes, <a href=#>the actor who portrayed Ross went through some tough times</a>, particularly because of his fame.</p><p>"It made me want to hide under a baseball cap and not be seen. And I realized after a while that I was no longer watching people; I was trying to hide. So I was trying to figure out: How do I be an actor in this new world, in this new situation? How do I do my job? That was tricky."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his off-screen troubles, Schwimmer always brought his best to the set of Friends.

One fans was wise to point out the moment between Ross and Monica, which they relived on the show. "Cringiest moment of the entire show is when they revealed Monica and Ross accidentally made out in college. Just...WHY?"</p><p>According to general opinion, Ross' character seems to take a steep decline in terms of his decisions and smarts around season 5.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Was Caught Laughing By 'Friends' Fans During This Hilarious Scene With Ross</a></span></p><p>Nonetheless, during the final episodes, he finally seems to get it together, realizing what he wants in the future, and that includes being with Rachel when she was about to move overseas.

One of the notable names took part in season 7, episode 19 'The One with Ross and Monica's Cousin'. Of course, we're talking about Denise Richards and her cameo in the April of 2001 episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly enough, the episode marked Chandler's shortest appearance ever on the sitcom, which was clocked in at 100-seconds.</p><p>Ross played a prominent role in the episode, entertaining his cousin Cassie Gellar. During the episode, Ross was going through a major dry spell with the ladies.
