When I think, my movies started become more bigger and bigger. But he was always ahead of me career-wise and money-wise. When I was making a million dollars a movie, he already was making ten million dollars a movie."</p><p>Schwarzenegger continued, "So he was ahead, but then eventually I caught up and that's when the s**t hit the fan. He didn't like that. I didn't like him, you know, kind of all of sudden getting into my turf and having a ripped body.
