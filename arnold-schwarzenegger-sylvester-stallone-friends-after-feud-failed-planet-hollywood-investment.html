When I think, my movies started become more bigger and bigger. But he was always ahead of me career-wise and money-wise. When I was making a million dollars a movie, he already was making ten million dollars a movie."</p><p>Schwarzenegger continued, "So he was ahead, but then eventually I caught up and that's when the s**t hit the fan. He didn't like that. I didn't like him, you know, kind of all of sudden getting into my turf and having a ripped body.

Of course, I am disappointed that the company did not continue with the success I had expected and hoped for.”</p><p>In 2002, Stallone actually filed a lawsuit over his Planet Hollywood involvement. Stallone sued his former business manager for convincing him not to sell his Planet Hollywood stock before the company went bankrupt. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stallone sought $17.3 million in the lawsuit</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6afobFuv8Khrpqqqpq7prPGnqlmq6mhw6a%2F056pZquklrmtu82eZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BMmp2tnaJis6bBw2admqGcmrFuvMuapZ6sXZ28rbjYsKaonF2eu7ex0q2knqakZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sal-vulcano-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sal Vulcano Bio (Wiki)</a>
