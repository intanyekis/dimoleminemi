In addition, he has been active in the sporting world, participating in Paralympic seven-a-side soccer.</p><p>During the Paralympic Summer Games that took place in Athens, Greece in 2004, Josh was a member of the United States national squad.</p><h2><span id=An_Investigation_into_the_Josh_Blue_Family>An Investigation into the Josh Blue Family</span></h2><p>Josh Blue’s parents, Walter Blue and Jacqui Blue, brought him into the world in Cameroon.

Bananas and peanuts were thrown at him by a confused crowd, and he remarked, “that was the best day I ate in Senegal!” in response to their gifts.</p><p>At the moment, Josh and his family can be found living in Denver, Colorado. They have a boy named Simon and a daughter named Saika.</p><p>He and his ex-wife, Yuko Blue, who he divorced in 2014 after they had been married for seven years, have joint custody of their children.</p><h2><span id=In_June_of_2023_Josh_Blue8217s_Net_Worth>In June of 2023, Josh Blue’s Net Worth</span></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Josh Blue has a net worth of one million dollars. Because of his high moral standards and successful profession as a comedian, he now has a net worth of one million dollars.</p><p>Josh is perhaps best known for his victory in the fourth season of the NBC reality television series Last Comic Standing. In addition to that, he finished in second place in the 16th season of America’s Got Talent.</p><p>He began his comedy career by competing in and ultimately won the Comedy Works New Talent Search competition in 2002. His comedy career began at The Evergreen State College.</p><p>In a similar vein, he was awarded a prize of $10,000 for triumphing in the Royal Flush Comedy Competition that was held at the Las Vegas Comedy Festival in 2004.</p><p>Josh has made guest appearances on a number of different television shows, including Live with Regis and Kelly.
