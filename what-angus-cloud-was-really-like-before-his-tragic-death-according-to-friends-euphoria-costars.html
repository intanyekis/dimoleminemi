Or, rather, their budding romance was. Unfortunately, when/if Euphoria returns for a third season, this storyline will never be the same. And nor will Lexi Howard's Maude Apatow, who took to Instagram to share her immense grief at the July 31st, 2023 passing of her friend and on-screen love-interest, Angus Cloud.</p><p>"Angus was the funniest person ever. I would get so excited to see on the schedule that we would be working together because I knew we’d have the best day, laughing so hard. He was the sweetest and made everyone around him so happy. He was just the best. Words can’t really capture how magical of a person he was. My heart is broken," Maude Apatow wrote on her Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Euphoria Might Be Maude Apatow's Claim To Fame, But She's Not Afraid To Branch Out</a></span></p><p>"Angus, getting to know and work with you was one of the greatest joys and blessings of my life. I will love you forever."</p><p>The caption was accompanied by numerous behind-the-scenes photos of her and Cloud clowning around together. They painted a picture of a man who was the life of the party. As well as revealed that he and Apatow were indeed friends when the cameras weren't rolling.</p><h2 id=what-did-sydney-sweeney-say-about-angus-cloud><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Did Sydney Sweeney Say About Angus Cloud?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/untitled-design-5-1.jpg><p>Sydney Sweeney's Cassie shared less screen time with Angus Cloud's Fezco than Maude Apatow's Lexi did. However, it's clear that the up-and-coming A-list star was very much a fan of Cloud's. In fact, it appears as though Sweeney considered Cloud a friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Angus you were an open soul, with the kindest heart, and you filled every room with laughter," Sydney Sweeney wrote on Instagram following his sudden passing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney's Dog Tank Gets Some Very Special Privileges: Here's The Truth About Her Extremely Pampered Pitbull Mix</a></span></p><p>Sweeney then went on to detail her relationship with Cloud.</p><p>"This is the hardest thing I've ever had to post, and I'm struggling to find all the words. You will be missed more than you know, but I'm so blessed to have known you in this lifetime, and I'm sure everyone who has ever met you feels the same.

And given that Zendaya is the face of the show as well as its biggest star, many fans were looking to her when news broke of his tragic death.</p><p>"Words are not enough to describe the infinite beauty that is Angus (Conor)," Zendaya wrote on Instagram.</p><p>"I’m so grateful I got the chance to know him in this life, to call him a brother, to see his warm kind eyes and bright smile, or hear his infectious cackle of a laugh (I’m smiling now just thinking of it) I know people use this expression often when talking about folks they love…'they could light up any room they entered' but boy let me tell you, he was the best at it. I’d like to remember him that way. For all of the boundless light, love and joy he always managed to give us. I’ll cherish every moment.

The much younger star has shared very little on social media or publicly since Angus Cloud's death. But previous to his passing, Walton told Page Six that he's closest to Cloud of all the Euphoria cast.</p><p>“We FaceTime often. Me and him are really close," Walton explained to Page Six. "[Angus Cloud is] exactly like you see him. He’s so fun to hang out with. He’s a good guy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following Cloud's tragic death, Walton posted a couple of simple and heartbreaking comments on Instagram.

According to Page Six, a number of other celebrities shared their heartache following his tragic 2023 passing, which, according to ET, his mother believes was not intentional.</p><p>Other Euphoria co-stars also shared their feelings on Instagram, including Storm Reid who claimed to be unable to wrap her head around what happened. Chloe Cherry, Colman Domingo, Alexa Demie, and Lukas Gage also shared their pain with their followers. The show's executive producer Drake also made a statement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Angus Cloud And Javon Walton Were Heartbroken At The End Of 'Euphoria' Season 2</a></span></p><p>But celebrities outside of the Euphoria family also made comments. This includes Cloud's friends Big Sean, Denzel Curry, and Jordyn Woods. Other celebrities to come out and say something include Jenni 'JWoww' Farley, Gigi Hadid, Kerry Washington, Suki Waterhouse, Molly Shannon (who sent her love to Sydney Sweeney), Billie Eilish, Rachel Zegler, Kid Cudi, and Kate Hudson (who sent her love to Maude Apatow). Maude Apatow's sister, Iris, shared this message on Instagram:</p><p>"A genuinely kindhearted person. I'm really glad to have gotten to know him."</p><p>It's unknown if Angus Cloud was actually friends with any of these other celebrities.
