He started his career as an actor on&nbsp;<strong>Saturday Night Live</strong>,&nbsp;and <a href=#>his performance on that show turned him into a huge star</a>. However, most of his wealth comes from the several&nbsp;high-grossing movies he has starred in and his stand-up comedy special deal with Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Everything We Know About Eddie Murphy's 10 Kids</a></span></p><p>Some of Eddie Murphy's&nbsp;most successful movies include&nbsp;Beverly Hills Cop, Dr. Dolitte,&nbsp;<i>Mulan,&nbsp;</i>and all four films in the&nbsp;Shrek&nbsp;franchise. The&nbsp;Shrek&nbsp;films collectively grossed about $3 billion at the box office, and Murphy took home quite the pay check for his role as Donkey. <a href=#>According to reports, he received a&nbsp;$12 million salary for his work in Shrek Forever After&nbsp;and he took home a significant percentage of the box office revenue</a>&nbsp;as well. In addition, he is reportedly&nbsp;earning approximately&nbsp;$70 million from&nbsp;his new stand-up deal with Netflix.</p><p>Clearly, Eddie Murphy has done very well for himself financially. But is the same true for his family members? Here's what we know about Eddie Murphy's family members' net worths.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eddie-murphy-s-family><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Eddie Murphy's Family</span></h2><p>Unlike many Hollywood celebrities, Eddie Murphy doesn't have many family members in the public eye. Neither of his parents were entertainers, nor are any of his children. However, his&nbsp;brother Charlie Murphy was an actor and comedian, and his step-brother Vernon Lynch has worked as a television producer. Eddie Murphy has also dated and had children with several famous women, including models, singers, and television presenters.</p><h2 id=charlie-murphy-2-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Charlie Murphy ($2.5 Million)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eddie Murphy's most famous blood relative was his brother Charlie Murphy, who was a successful actor and stand-up comedian in his own right. He was a writer and performer on&nbsp;Chappelle's Show&nbsp;and also played a main role on the TV series&nbsp;Black Jesus.&nbsp;Sadly, he passed away in 2017 at just 57 years of age.&nbsp;<a href=#>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Charlie Murphy had a&nbsp;net worth of&nbsp;$2.5 million when he died</a>.</p><h2 id=vernon-lynch-unknown><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Vernon Lynch (Unknown)</span></h2><p>Vernon Lynch is Eddie Murphy's step-brother from his mother's second marriage. Lynch co-wrote the 1995 film&nbsp;Vampire in Brooklyn&nbsp;alongside Murphy, and he also worked as a music consultant on one of Murphy's most recent films,&nbsp;Coming 2 America.&nbsp;In addition, Vernon Lynch served as an executive producer on&nbsp;Hollywood Exes,&nbsp;a reality show which starred Eddie Murphy's ex-wife Nicole. Unfortunately, Vernon Lynch's net worth is not listed on Celebrity Net Worth, so it's unclear how much money he has today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Eddie Murphy Almost Made A 'Coming To America' TV Show</a></span></p><h2 id=mel-b-6-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mel B ($6 Million)</span></h2><p>Melanie Brown, also known as Mel B, is a member of the popular 1990s girl group The Spice Girls. <a href=#>She dated Eddie Murphy for a few months in 2006</a>, and although the two never married, <a href=#>Murphy allegedly had plans to propose</a>. Melanie Brown&nbsp;is included on this list because she and Eddie Murphy have a daughter together, <a href=#>a 14-year-old girl named Angel</a>. While Angel is still just a child and there is no reason to&nbsp;speculate about her net worth, we can report that her mother has <a href=#>an estimated $6 million fortune according to Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-mitchell-murphy-10-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nicole Mitchell Murphy ($10 Million)</span></h2><p>While Eddie Murphy has been in several high-profile relationships, and while he has ten children with four different women, he has only been married once in his life. From&nbsp;1993-2006, he was married to Nicole Mitchell Murphy, with whom he has five children. While Nicole is perhaps best known for her marriage to Murphy, she was a successful model for several years and she also starred in 3 seasons of the reality TV program&nbsp;Hollywood Exes.&nbsp;<a href=#>According to Celebrity Net Worth, she is worth $10 million today</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Much Eddie Murphy Pays In Child Support</a></span></p><h2 id=tracey-edmonds-60-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tracey Edmonds&nbsp;($60 Million)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Briefly after his relationship with Mel B, Eddie&nbsp;Murphy had&nbsp;a romance with Tracey Edmonds. Edmonds is n Emmy Award-winning TV presenter, known for her work hosting&nbsp;Extra. She is also&nbsp;a film and TV producer, having produced films such as&nbsp;<i>Soul Food&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;Good Luck Chuck.&nbsp;From 1992 until 2005, she was married to the Grammy-winning singer and songwriter Babyface.&nbsp;Edmonds and Murphy&nbsp;appeared to have a wedding ceremony in January 2008, <a href=#>but they broke up shortly afterwards</a>. The couple later clarified that <a href=#>their wedding&nbsp;was just "symbolic" in nature and that they did&nbsp;not have a "legal ceremony."</a></p><h2 id=paige-butcher-unknown><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Paige Butcher (Unknown)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paige Butcher is currently in a relationship with Eddie Murphy, and the two have been dating since at least 2012. Butcher is the mother of Murphy's ninth and tenth children, a daughter born in 2016 and a son born in 2018. Butcher is&nbsp;a model, and she also played small roles in two Hollywood films:&nbsp;Something's Gotta Give&nbsp;and Big Momma's House 2,&nbsp;<a href=#>where she met Eddie Murphy for the first time</a>.&nbsp;Her net worth is not available on Celebrity Net Worth, and other sources provide conflicting information about her true net worth, ranging from <a href=#>$800,000 on one website</a>&nbsp;to <a href=#>$40 million on another</a>. However, no matter what her true net worth is, it's safe to assume that Butcher is financially stable due to&nbsp;her relationship with Eddie Murphy.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Why Eddie Murphy Quit Acting For Six Years</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyaqZ5llZmxqrGMpqyrqJiuwG6ywKagpbFdorKursSrqmavn6fBqXnIp2RraGJmfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./marc-fisher-ltd-padmia-chelsea-boot-sale-nordstrom.html>&#171;&nbsp;Marc Fisher Chelsea Boots Are 34% Off and Super Trendy</a>
