Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>The prominent basketball player Dave Lattin is unquestionably affluent and accomplished. However, neither his salary nor net worth is mentioned on the Internet.</p><p>In addition to basketball, he must have made a substantial income from his commercial pursuits. Internet sources indicate that in the 1960s, NBA athletes earned an annual salary of $525,000.

Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Let’s begin with the fundamentals: Dave was born on December 23, 1943, in Houston, Texas, to his bereaved mother, Elsie. Unfortunately, his father abandoned him in 1949 when he was only six years old.</p><p>However, details about his father and the cause of his father’s death remain unknown.</p><p>Dave attended elementary and secondary institutions in Houston before graduating from Evan E. Worthing Senior High School there in 1963. He attended Attucks Middle School and Crispus Attucks Junior High School previously.</p><p>Dave chose Worthing because he desired to investigate his potential and because it was a larger high school than the previous one he attended.</p><p>Simply put, joining Worthing was one of the greatest decisions you could have made in your life.</p><p>Dave was able to acquire a multitude of knowledge as a result, as he became the first high school All-American in his eleventh-grade year. In addition, he was the first high school All-American in basketball from the state of Texas.</p><p>Later on, he began to progressively encounter success. A small humorous occurrence occurred during this period. Someone had already informed his mother of his success.</p><p>When his mother unexpectedly entered their home, he was sitting in the chair with his leg raised on the coffee table. She was entirely unappreciative.</p><p>“Okay, Mr. High School All-American, it’s great that you are a high school All-American, but you still need to remove your foot from my coffee table!” shouted a voice abruptly.</p><p>College is one of the additional opportunities available after high school for establishing a solid foundation. Dave departed Tennessee in 1964 because he was unable to find challenging competition there.</p><p>Dave moved back to Houston, joined the AAAU, and in 1965 received a full scholarship to Texas Western College. There, he played for the NCAA Division 1 Miners team.</p><p>In 1966, under the supervision of Coach Don Haskins, the Miners claimed the NCAA Division 1 National Championship with five African-American starters. He was named an All-American in 1966 and 1967.</p><p>At that precise moment, his life changed dramatically, and the victory enabled the institutions to practice exceptional racial equality in athletics.</p><p>They won the championships in 1966 by dispatching an all-white Kentucky team.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto"><tbody><tr><td><b>Full Name</b></td><td>David Lattin</td></tr><tr><td><b>Birth Date</b></td><td>December 23, 1943</td></tr><tr><td><b>Birth Place</b></td><td>Houston, Texas</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nick Name</b></td><td><strong>Big Daddy D</strong></td></tr><tr><td><b>Religion</b></td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nationality</b></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><b>Ethnicity</b></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><b>Education</b></td><td>Evan Edward Worthing Early College High School, University of Texas</td></tr><tr><td><b>Horoscope</b></td><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td><b>Father’s Name</b></td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mother’s Name</b></td><td>Elsie Lattin</td></tr><tr><td><b>Siblings</b></td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td><b>Age</b></td><td>78 years old</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>1.98m(6’6″)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>102 kg(224 lb)</td></tr><tr><td><b>NBA draft</b></td><td>1967/ Round:1/ Pick: tenth overall</td></tr><tr><td><b>Hair Color</b></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><b>Eye Color</b></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><b>Last played for</b></td><td>Memphis Tams</td></tr><tr><td><b>Build</b></td><td>Athlete</td></tr><tr><td><b>Marital Status</b></td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td><b>Kids</b></td><td>son (Clifton) and daughter (Leslie)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Position</b></td><td>Power Forward/ Center</td></tr><tr><td><b>Profession</b></td><td>NBA player, Writer, Entrepreneur</td></tr><tr><td><b>Net Worth</b></td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td><b>Salary</b></td><td>$5,25,000 annually (in 1960’s)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Number</b></td><td>47, 43, 33, 22</td></tr><tr><td><b>League</b></td><td>NBA</td></tr><tr><td><b>Active Since</b></td><td>1967-1973</td></tr><tr><td><b>Social Media</b></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><b>Merch</b></td><td>Book “Slam Dunk to Glory“</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td width=468>July, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=How_did_Dave_Lattin_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Dave Lattin start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>After graduating from Texas Western College in 1967, the San Francisco Warriors of the NBA League selected Dave with the tenth overall selection.</p><p>He was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League with the 443rd overall selection in the 1967 NFL Draft.</p><p>Wide receiver was the primary reason for Dave’s employment.
