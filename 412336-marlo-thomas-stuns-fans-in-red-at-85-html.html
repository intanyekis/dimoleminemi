It seemed the day she posed in red with Rice was the day she glammed up for the magazine shoot.</p><p class=fh>Being somewhat of a fashion icon is something <a class="Ed a" href=#>Thomas</a> embraced long ago and hasn't let go in her older years. The actress once spoke about how she felt about her looks in her eighties and how her husband supports her.</p><p><h2 class=jh><strong class=dh>What Did Marlo Say about Fashion and Her Husband's Take On It?</strong></h2></p><p class=fh>In January 2017, Thomas was close to turning 80 and was launching a clothing line aptly called "That Woman" when she was asked why she felt it was important to still feel sexy at that age. The star said it was always important to feel that way as women and men had to be authentic.</p><p class=fh>Speaking about her husband's fashion, she revealed he would often wear jeans, V-neck cashmere sweaters, and striped shirts, and he looked good in them even if he could've worn the outfits 40 years before. She thought the most important is one's spiritâwhich she dressed forâand not her age.</p><p class=fh>The celebrity also described Donahue's style as preppy and conservative, while she leans more on classic. Thomas also shared that she consulted him on her clothing line, and while she <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://fashionweekdaily.com/marlo-thomas-on-her-new-clothing-line-staying-sexy-loving-life/>admits</a>, he's "not a fashionista," he would offer an opinion or two. For instance, he loved the blue dress she wore to her launch party and the suede jacket she featured in her collection.</p><p class=fh>Sharing more about her husband, the actress <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://fashionweekdaily.com/marlo-thomas-on-her-new-clothing-line-staying-sexy-loving-life/>described</a> him as cool and not critical, adding, " He gets a kick out of watching me enjoy what I do." When she told him about her idea for a clothing line, he thought it was great and supported her. "You're born to do this!" he egged.</p><p class=fh>When it came to how she and Donahue managed to make their marriage a success, the star says giving it time is what works. The couple would take trips alone, and since their first anniversary, they decided not to buy each other gifts but to spend their money on trips.</p><p class=fh>Speaking about age, Thomas said she didn't think women over 40 didn't want to look older but that they wished to appear as the girls inside them. During a conversation with her husband, they figured men brought some of their boyishness in them when they were older, while women did the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f31f253861d8786c7a25e661fe87ebb2091b3398465991b3abc49fdcdb10e87e.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Marlo Thomas at the 48th annual Gracie Awards in Beverly Hills, California, on May 23, 2023 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>Their clothes needed to "have that feeling about them"; otherwise, they didn't make you feel like yourself.

Cole said <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/marlo-thomas-that-girl-163140/>Thomas' character</a> stood out because of her independence and aspirations as a woman.</p><p class=fh>Cole also revealed part of the appeal of the show was being able to meld fantasy and reality in Thomas' character.
