From hosting MTV shows to being in <a href=#>one of the biggest boy bands ever</a>, the couple have accomplished a lot, and they have made plenty of money while doing so.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the Lacheys and see how much they're worth.</p><h2 id=how-much-are-nick-and-vanessa-lachey-worth>How Much Are Nick And Vanessa Lachey Worth?</h2><p>In February 2020, Netflix struck gold with a little show called Love is Blind. The premise of the show was simple and effective, and the show turned into a colossal hit.</p><p>From the jump Nick and Vanessa Lachey have been hosting the show, and while they aren't around much, they've been a great fit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When speaking on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why the couple agreed to host the show</a>, Nick said, "When Netflix approached us with Love is Blind all those years ago, we jumped at the opportunity because the show really spoke to us personally. When we first started dating, Vanessa was in New York and I was in Los Angeles. We didn't get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other."</p><p>The flexible schedule also played a part in their decision to host the show.</p><p>Now, there is no way of knowing how things will play out when a show is put into production, but Love is Blind has turned into one of the most popular shows on TV. This is great news for the Lacheys, who are cashing in every step of the way.</p><p>It's amazing to see where they are now, considering that they've been together for so long in an industry known for short unions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Love Is Blind' Season 2 Cast's Real-Life Careers</a></span></p><h2 id=the-duo-have-been-together-for-years>The Duo Have Been Together For Years</h2><p>For the last 16 years, Nick and Vanessa Lachey have been thriving together, and the couple got things started years back thanks to a music video.</p><p>"Lachey then began dating Vanessa Minnillo in 2006, after she starred in his "What's Left of Me" music video. After a brief break-up in 2009 that only lasted a few months, the couple became engaged in November 2010. They married in 2011, and they three children together," writes Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>Even with a major change thanks to global events over the last couple years, the duo has continued to thrive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's definitely challenged us in good and bad ways. Definitely held a magnifying glass to things, and it's made us stronger in the end. We are forced to communicate. There's no leaving for a show, or leaving for a job and then being away going, 'Hey, I'm sorry, I miss you, I'm coming back.' It's having to deal with it in person, [Nick] saying 'I messed up,' or 'I messed up,' or 'I want to communicated better,'" said Vanessa.</p><p>The couple are thriving personally, and as it were, they are thriving financially.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Other Engaged 'Love Is Blind' Couples Not Featured On Season 2, Revealed</a></span></p><h2 id=nick-and-vanessa-lachey-have-a-huge-combined-net-worth>Nick And Vanessa Lachey Have A Huge Combined Net Worth</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Nick and Vanessa are worth a combined $25 million, meaning that they are quite comfortable financially.</p><p>Each of them have contributed to their wealth, as both were successful when they first struck up a relationship. Vanessa primarily made her money on TV, while Nick was topping the charts and touring the world with 98 Degrees years back.</p><p>Nick has also had business ventures outside the world of music, including have an ownership stake in a few teams.</p><p>Per the site, "He's part owner of an American Basketball Association team, the Hollywood Fame, and has also been part of an ownership group of the Tacoma Rainiers."</p><p>Interestingly, a major chunk of change went Lachey's way years back when he separated from former wife, Jessica Simpson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Because Simpson had not signed a pre-nuptial agreement, she reportedly had to pay Lachey $12 million in their divorce. Ironically, before the marriage Nick had asked Jessica to sign a pre-nup. She angrily refused," writes Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>Obviously, he didn't take home every penny of that after taxes and legal fees, but that is still a significant amount of money to be made from separating from someone.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What 'Love Is Blind' Star Shake Chatterjee's Life Is Like Off The Show</a></span></p><p>Thanks to the success of Love is Blind and landing another show for Netflix, Nick and Vanessa Lachey have a chance to continue expanding their wealth.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Love Is Blind Season 2 Episode 10 Review: 'The Weddings'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyaqZ5lnp6wrHnAp5tmrpGjsrS%2FwGajmpuYmsZuw86rq6FlnKTDpnnIrGSbpJmjsXA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ivy-jane-kane-bio-wiki-age-harry-kane-children-parents-family-height-net-worth-instagram.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ivy Jane Kane Bio, Wiki, Age, Harry Kane Children, Parents, Family, Height, Net Worth, Instagram</a>
